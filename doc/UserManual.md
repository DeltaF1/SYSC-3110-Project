# Really Terrible Plants VS Zombies [now with time travel]

**Core features**
------
When you start the game you will be greeted with a splash screen. Press the `Start Game` button to start the game.  

Once the game begins you will have 150 sun points. If you don't plant a sunflower using these points you will almost certainly lose.  
To plant a sunflower simply click the sunflower picture at the bottom of the screen, and then click on anywhere in the grid to place it.

To advance the game to the next state, click the `End turn` button.  Zombies should appear on the right of the map.  If the zombies get to the left side of the map you lose.

Now that you understand how to play the game, here are a list of other features: 


**Plants**
------

_"Attack like the Fire and be still as the Mountain"._  
\- Sun Tzu, The Art of War

#### Projectile plant (aka proj)

Shoots straight forward at oncoming zombies to lower their health/morale

#### Sunflower

Generates 50 sun every turn

#### Melonpult (aka melon)

Has a picture of a Minecraft melon as part of its icon  
Also does 3 times more damage than a Projectile plant

#### Walnut

The only fully sentient plant in the entire garden. Each and every walnut has laughed, cried, loved, and been loved. Every walnut has seen beauty, known fear, felt wonder, and shed tears of joy. Every walnut has its own walnut family, with little walnut children, walnut parents, sisters, brothers, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. In a cruel twist of fate, it is also the only plant that is completely defenseless; it cannot move, nor attack the mindless beasts that threaten its very existence. It is fully aware that it has 2.5x as much health as a Sunflower or Peashooter, and that when the end does come it will not be instant but excruciatingly long, painful, and terrifying. It stares aimlessly toward the oncoming zombie horde with an expression of miserable acceptance, knowing that it is already dead.

#### Repeater

2x attack speed



**Zombies**
------
_"Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them."_  
\- Deuteronomy 31:6

#### Zombie

Just your run of the mill zombie. Pretty pathetic honestly

#### Boomer
![](https://imgur.com/7wpECPh.png)  
Has 2x as much health as a regular Zombie.  
Can be heard mumbling about how much better the original Plants vs Zombies was in between sips of ice cold Monster Zero Ultraâ„¢.  Wandered into the garden in search of a ride on lawn mower

#### Zoomer
![](https://imgur.com/ehnudNf.png)  
Moves extremely quickly, with twice the speed of a normal Zombie.   
The Zoomer is constantly doing a perfect Fortnite floss to 6IX9INE's GUMMO, with a dab thrown in every 15 - 30 seconds for good measure. Fortunately, the game does not have any animations so none of these actions can actually be seen

#### Doomer
![](https://imgur.com/ptk5ABZ.png)  
Nothing left to lose. Didn't really think they could get more pathetic than the basic Zombie, but here we are. The Doomer's black pill induced rage gives it 2x the attack power of a regular Zombie

## **Tile Info**

Clicking on a tile retrieves information about the entity at the specified location. This information tells you about the entity's health, damage, name, speed and social security number

## **Time travel**

Pressing the `undo` button turns back time to the beginning of the last turn. Pressing the `redo` button will bring you forwards in time, essentially undoing an undo.    
**warning:** Real Gamers do not ever use this feature because it is overpowered and game breaking. If you use this feature you are not a real Gamer

## **Level Editor**

(don't even bother reading this one because we're doing everything kind of last minute and I'm too lazy to put in jokes)

Pressing the `Open Level Editor` button on the main menu opens the level editor. Inside the level editor you can create and save your own levels. Below is an explanation of what each button does

#### add zombie
Clicking this button will add a zombie to the level. You must specify a valid zombie name ("basic", "boomer", "zoomer" or "doomer") and the turn number that the zombie will spawn on.

#### remove zombie
Clicking this button will remove the currently selected zombie from the editor

#### edit zombie
Clicking this button allows you to edit the currently selected zombie

#### leave editor
Clicking this button brings you back to the home screen
