# Really Terrible Plants VS Zombies

**Core features**
------
When you start the game you will be greeted with a splash screen. Press the `Start Game` button to start the game.  

Once the game begins you will have 150 sun points. If you don't plant a sunflower using these points you will almost certainly lose.  
To plant a sunflower simply click the sunflower picture at the bottom of the screen, and then click on anywhere in the grid to place it.

To advance the game to the next state, click the `End turn` button.  Zombies should appear on the right of the map.  If the zombies get to the left side of the map you lose.

Now that you understand how to play the game, here are a list of other features:
